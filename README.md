ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It also includes preprocessing of a custom image (6.jpeg) to test the model's prediction capabilities. 
Highlights
- Preprocessing pipeline for grayscale digit images
- CNN architecture with dropout and max pooling
- Training on MNIST dataset with validation
- Prediction on custom input image
- Visualization of original and preprocessed image
